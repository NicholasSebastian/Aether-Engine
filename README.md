# Aether-Engine
Was trying to make a game engine with GLFW with LWJGL's Java Bindings for OpenGL...  
But then I slowly realized how difficult and time consuming this project can be so its on hold for now.

## Features so far
1. Opens a window.
2. Game loop with V-sync.
3. Keyboard and mouse inputs.
4. Time class for profiling FPS and managing deltaTime.
5. Basic scene manager.
6. Renders a rainbow-colored square to the screen. (I had no idea it was this complicated...)
